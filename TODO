Daemon style
========================================
* Update multitrack.conf
[Satellites]
RAX-2=<command string>
 --> command string should ideally be a script that accepts start/stop/restart
 ----> allows for clean startup and shutdown of telemetry collection programs
 ----> also could do this as a forked process, then kill child when pass is over
 --> calls $HOME/RAX_Private_GS/run_gs_client.sh (or equivalent)

* daemon mode operation

 loop()
 	get_el(all_sats);

	for sat in sats:
		if el >= -5 deg:
			run_pass();
			break;

	sleep(~5 seconds);

* Update $CONFIG_DIR/sats/<satid>.sat
	** satid can be common name, nickname or NORAD ID
	** should contain TLE
		*** Can this be done in plain text at heading?
		*** If not, then a temp file will be needed to feed the TLE
		 	into satpredict
	** should contain names (if characters need modification)
	** should contain transponder data
